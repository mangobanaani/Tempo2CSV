# Tempo2CSV
Fetches Tempo (Atlassian JIRA plugin) worklogs and converts it to CSV. 

Tempo.io is quite popular JIRA -plugin which tracks time fluently spent on projects, issues and whatnot. The UI has functionality to extract information, but this little program calling API will help to completely automate it. 

My purpose with this was to automate analyzing and predicting Tempo worklogs with R, but it's not limited to that. Some very simple R examples and basic plots are provided to help to get you started, if you are interested in that.
